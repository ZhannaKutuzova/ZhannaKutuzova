Platform Engineering • Backend • AI Systems • Cloud Infrastructure

I build production-ready software platforms — from backend architecture and cloud infrastructure to deployment pipelines and AI-powered automation.

- **Backend Systems** — APIs, auth flows, business logic, integrations
- **Cloud Infrastructure** — AWS environments, Terraform, networking, deployment foundations
- **DevOps & CI/CD** — GitHub Actions, Docker workflows, preview environments, release pipelines
- **AI Integrations** — LLM workflows, multi-agent orchestration, automation pipelines
- **Production Operations** — monitoring, stability, scaling, cost optimization
