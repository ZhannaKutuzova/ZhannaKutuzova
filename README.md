Hi, I'm Zhanna 👋
Software Engineer | Backend & Platform Systems | AI Integrations
I build production-ready backend platforms, cloud infrastructure, and AI-powered systems.
Focused on architecture, automation, reliability, and scalable deployment.
What I Do
I work across the full engineering lifecycle — from system design to production operations.
Backend Engineering — APIs, auth flows, business logic, integrations
Platform Architecture — modular systems, reusable services, scalable foundations
Cloud Infrastructure — AWS environments, containerized services, infrastructure as code
DevOps & CI/CD — automated pipelines, preview deployments, production releases
AI Integrations — LLM workflows, multi-agent orchestration, automation systems
Production Reliability — monitoring, stability, cost optimization, performance tuning
